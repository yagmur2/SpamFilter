Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word \\'george\\' and the area code \\'650\\' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.\\n\\nFor background on spam: Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam!, Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.\\n\\nTypical performance is around ~7% misclassification error.
